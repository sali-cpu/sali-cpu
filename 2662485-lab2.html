            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p> I created the snake game for my 2nd year Computer Science Project. It taught me a lot about backtracking and path of least resistance. You initially want code your snake in a way to find the shortest path but it can cause our run into other snakes but you need to find the most optimal path</p>
